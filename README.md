# Project Description
Foreign tourists entering Thailand make a major contribution to the Thai economy. Identifying the recent trends and forecasting expected numbers of tourists in the near future enable the Thai government to better attract tourists and allocate its resources. 

In this project, we worked with Thai tourism data from data.world. Specifically, we focused on the tourists from the United States who visited Thailand. Using different time series models, we tried to predict the number of tourists from the United States.

# Data
We had access to the Thai tourism data, which starts from 2010 to 2016 (monthly data)
